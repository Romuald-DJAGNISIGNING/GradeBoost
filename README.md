2. Backend Setup (Django)
Create a Virtual Environment:


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Frontend Setup (React.js)
Install Frontend Dependencies:


cd frontend
npm install

npm start
The frontend will now be available at http://localhost:3000/.

4. Running the Development Server:
Once the backend and frontend are set up, you can start the Django development server:


python manage.py runserver
The backend will now be running at http://localhost:8000/.

5. Deployment:
For production, deploy your app using Docker, Nginx, and Gunicorn. Configuration files for these technologies can be found in the repository.

API Documentation:
The GradeBoost web app uses a RESTful API to handle user authentication, bookings, payments, and other operations. You can find the API documentation in the /docs folder. For easy integration with the frontend, we use the Django REST Framework.
